## About Me
Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Economics of Education and Education Policy at the Stanford University Graduate School of Education. 

I study how policy and practice influence students' educational opportunities and achievement, with a focus on curricular reform, targeted interventions for special student populations, and math pathways. For example, I explore how district decisions on the scope, sequence and assignment practices of high school math impact student proficiency, engagement, and preparation for college and careers. An overarching aim of my research agenda is to understand the educational, organizational, and political implications of choices schools make to negotiate perceived trade-offs in equality and efficiency goals.

My research uses descriptive and causal quantitative methods to produce evidence relevant to local and national policy discussions. I frequently engage with research practice partners in schools and districts. This ensures my work responds to and informs policies that directly impact the quality and accessibility of educational programs.

Prior to becoming a researcher, I was a math teacher at a high school in Houston, TX. 

My CV is available [here](https://ehuffaker.github.io/files/EHuffakerCV.pdf).
