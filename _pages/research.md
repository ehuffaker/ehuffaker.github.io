## Media Coverage and Recognition

My research with Sarah Novicoff and Thomas S. Dee on a controversial reform to high school math pathways in San Francisco was covered by [Education Week](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/san-francisco-insisted-on-algebra-in-9th-grade-did-it-improve-equity/2023/03), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/18/san-franciscos-woke-maths-experiment) and local outlets including the [The San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/sfusd-algebra-math-wars-stanford-study-17851567.php).

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/07/us/covid-kindergarten-enrollment.html) featured insights from the [Stanford School Enrollment Project](https://biglocalnews.org/content/collaborations/stanford-school-enrollment-project.html) and my study of public school disenrollment during COVID-19 with Thomas S. Dee and [Big Local News](https://biglocalnews.org/) journalists Cheryl Phillips and Eric Sagrara.

The Fordham Institute named this paper the [top education study of 2021](https://fordhaminstitute.org/national/commentary/counting-down-top-education-studies-2021), and The 74 featured it in ["16 Charts that Changed the Way We Looked at America's Schools in 2021"](https://www.the74million.org/article/16-charts-that-changed-the-way-we-looked-at-americas-schools-in-2021/). This study was also featuerd in a list of the ["top 10+ journalism collaborations of 2021"](https://medium.com/centerforcooperativemedia/here-are-the-top-10-journalism-collaborations-of-2021-210536efaaf1).

I was invited, with Thomas S. Dee, to present insights from this project at the 2023 Circle Night Lecture at the Stanford University Graduate School of Education.
