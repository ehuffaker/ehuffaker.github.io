May 2023 - My research with Sarah Novicoff and Thomas S. Dee on a controversial reform to high school math pathways in San Francisco was covered by [Education Week](https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/san-francisco-insisted-on-algebra-in-9th-grade-did-it-improve-equity/2023/03), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/05/18/san-franciscos-woke-maths-experiment) and local outlets including the [The San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/sfusd-algebra-math-wars-stanford-study-17851567.php).
