From 2013 to 2018, I was a math teacher at a high school in Houston, TX. These experiences motivated me to become an education researcher and continue to guide the questions I pose in my work. Now, I greatly appreciate the opportunities I have to mentor and teach students of all levels in using the tools that opened up the world of applied policy research to me.

## Graduate-Level Assistanships

[Quasi-Experimental Research Designs and Analysis](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&page=0&catalog=&q=EDUC430B) (EDUC 430B), Stanford University, Winters 2021-2023

This course surveys quantitative methods to make causal inferences in the absence of randomized experiment including the use of natural and quasi-experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, fixed effects estimators, and difference-in-differences. We emphasize the proper interpretation of these research designs and critical engagement with their key assumptions for applied researchers.

[Data Analysis for Policy and Decision Making I](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/education-policy-and-social-analysis/education-policy/courses/) (EDPA 4002), Teachers College Columbia, Fall 2018

This is an introductory course in quantitative research methods that focus on non-experimental designs and the analysis of large-scale longitudinal datasets, especially those related to education policy. Students become familiar with the logic of inferential statistics and the application of basic analytic techniques. No prior knowledge of statistics or quantitative methods is required.
